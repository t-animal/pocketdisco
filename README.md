# Usage

## Powering on
Simply plug in in the power plug. The disco will boot and after a while you'll hear some beeps and a voice. The disco is now ready.

## Playing songs
Press the shiny red button. Duh.

## Powering off
Press the shiny red button. Wait until the song is almost over (abou 15 seconds). Then press and hold the red button until you hear some beeps and a voice. The disco will now shut down. Unfortunately there is no way to tell if the disco has completely shut down. However after 5 minutes or so the disco is normally shut down. You can now pull the power plug.
